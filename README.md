- package.json file is necessary also add type: module inside it so that node js will conclude this folder as the module and
    let us use import and export.

- Javascript has 4 types of variables named String, Number, Boolean, Null & Undefined.
    - can't use whitespace , dash (-) and alphanumeric characters except $ and underscore( _ ) can be used in defining a
        vaiable name.

- Have all the operators(=, <=, >=, <,>, !=) which we have in other programming languages. Only difference is === to check equality.

- Arrow function , functions which are without function tag and also without function name. This are also known as arrow 
    function. Mostly use when we have to write a few lines of code inside the function then creating a function and calling it will be a cumbersome. while the simple solution is to use a anonymous function and directly defined some few
    lines of code inside the component or we want that function

- Arrays are just as normal as other programming languages.

- Destructure array like we do in python where we assign mulitple values at the same time here it use it with array, 
- Destructuring with objects will let us to use the field name of objects not like arrays first variable is assigned to 
    index 0, second var is assigned to index 1 and so on. 

- Also we can destructure the function parameters like this
    - function login({id, pass}), call it like this login(user) or login({id:1, pass:"3eq4sdf"});
    - user is object which has the variables id, pass, last_login, is_admin etc but only acquire the needed one. 

- Passing function as function parameter in js we are not bound to only pass values inside the function parameter but also 
    we can pass function as a parameter and the function which got function in a parameter can run it when it's needed.

- In react : function inside a function is a pretty common thing in react, but it's not in js. The interior function are only
    call inside the function not from outside of the function.
